**QUESTION 1**

The program I created demonstrates the use of the Chart.js library, which is a JavaScript library meant for creating your very own charts and graphs on a web page.

**QUESTION 2**

Running this program is very simple, all you have to do is open chart.html in your files and the graph should appear (you cannot run it in the termanal like typical JS programs).

**QUESTION 3**

The purpose of the program is to create a bar chart that demonstrates the number of monthly listeners for the top 5 most streamed artists on spotify. The data for the artists and their monthly listeners is provided in the topArtistsData array. The Chart.js library is used to render this data in the form of a bar chart.

**QUESTION 4**

If the program is ran correctly the sample output should be as shown:

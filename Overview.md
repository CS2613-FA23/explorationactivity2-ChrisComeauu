**QUESTION 1**

The library I selected is the Chart.js library.

**QUESTION 2**

**Purpose**:

The purpose of the Chart.js library is to allow users to create dynamic and visually appealing charts and graphs on web pages. This library is an easy-to-use solution for any programmers who need to represent data as charts or graphs. Chart.js allows users to specify their desired graph type, color of graph, and background (in RGB) and input data into an array, which is then mapped over to create the chart plot points[2]. The official Chart.js website [1] also includes many tutorials and sample programs to allow programmers to get familiar with the concepts of Chart.js before they create a program of their own.

**Usage**: 

To be able to use the Chart.js library, we must include a script tag with a link to its source: <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script> [2]. After we have included the link, programmers have access to the entire Chart.js library and are free to create charts and graphs customized to their liking.

Overall, the straightforward process to access Chart.js, as well as the numerous customizability options and tutorials, makes Chart.js a fantastic choice for both beginners and experienced programmers seeking a powerful yet accessible tool for chart and graph creation on the web.

**QUESTION 3**

Chart.js offers many possibilities for creating and customizing charts. Example:

As you can see, by using Chart.js, you have the option to customize almost everything, including the chart type, chart size, title(s), chart colors and transparency, background color and transparency, and much more.

**QUESTION 4**

Chart.js was announced and created in 2013 but has been updated frequenctly and come a long way since then. [1]

**QUESTION 5**

I selected the Chart.js library because of the visual appeal charts and graphs provide compared to a block of numbers and names. Being in Statistics, you realize the importance of graphs and how they allow us to easily interpret data, visualize trends/patterns, and compare and contrast the various data points.

**QUESTION 6**

Using Chart.js made me much more familiar and comfortable using JavaScript. However, early on, there was a learning curve learning the procedures for coding in an HTML document with the various script tags. Overall, I really enjoyed using the Chart.js library as it was very satisfying to see the final product of my graph, and it also enhanced my ability to code in JS.

**QUESTION 7**

I would definitely recommend this library to anyone interested in creating visually appealing charts with their code. It was not only extremely fun to create and modify but also quite simple to use. If I ever need to create charts in the future, I would definitely consider using Chart.js again because of the simplicity and usability of this library.

1. The program I created demonstrates the use of the Chart.js library, which is a JavaScript library meant for creating your very own charts and graphs on a web page.

3. The purpose of the program is to create a bar chart that demonstrates the number of monthly listeners for the top 5 most streamed artists on spotify. The data for the artists and their monthly listeners is provided in the topArtistsData array. The Chart.js library is used to render this data in the form of a bar chart.
